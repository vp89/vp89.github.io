2 weeks before my 30th birthday I decided to quit my job as a software developer. Some of my friends thought the timing of it was quite clever or badass. The dull reality is that I had to wait for bonus and stock options to pay out, as well as redeem some PTO that wouldn't have been paid out to me upon leaving.

I initially planned to not tell anyone that I quit my job and that I would be trying to go into business. I thought this would keep the pressure off of me and it would allow me to save face if I quickly realized it wasn't for me. I still think that would have been a good plan. Unfortunately I am not good at lying or obfuscating the truth from people I care about, so if you know me in real life, you probably have already heard about what I am going to be working on.

I will skip the schpiel (for now) about *why* I quit my job, and *why* I am giving this a shot. I tried to write that up but I have a pretty bad writer's block when it comes to talking about my feelings. The crux of it is that I did not find much satisfaction from being a *corporate* software developer, and I wanted to get back to the front lines.

And here I am. Very much on the front lines. Building a B2B SaaS product called dojomanage. The goal of this product is to make it easier for martial arts academy owners to run their businesses as well as attract and retain new customers. There is competition in this space, seemingly in the form of general purpose products built for fitness clubs. I believe there is an opportunity to capture some market share by providing a higher quality solution that caters specifically to this niche. This more targeted solution will provide customers with a strategic advantage over using existing products, specifically with new customer retention and added product value.

I have had this product idea for over a year and have been working on it sporadically, though I never really carved out large blocks of time to make a significant dent in it. To be frank I initially didn't believe enough in the idea, but I later realized that I am not just going into business to get rich and therefore my product idea doesn't need to be `tres commas`, as Russ Hanneman would say.

Because of this preliminary stage - where I had already stood up a lot of the boring, but necessary infrastructure to be able to build and deploy a web app - I was able to hit the ground running on "day 1" of this journey and slot right into a good working groove. So far I have been doing roughly 8-10 hour days split into 2 sessions. I wake up around 6-7am and do a 4-5 hour session, then take a long lunch break. After that I do another session in the afternoon and work until I feel satisfied with the day's progress.

There is no Scrum, no JIRA, no tickets. Just a list of tasks to do in a Google doc, in priority order. The way it ought to be. I tried using Trello but even that feels like too much overhead. I am hoping to have an "embarassing MVP" demo by the end of this week, after that I will begin doing sales. I think I will initially track my time on sales related tasks to ensure I am doing enough of it. I am aware of the cliche where developers start a business and spend all their time coding and will strive to not also fall prey to that, though I don't blame those people. Working on a real project after years of doing JIRA tickets is intoxicating.

My plan is to work on this product for 3 months and then assess whether to continue or abandon it. I will be living off of savings, so I would be wary of going for much longer than that without bringing *any* money in, but we'll see how things shake out. The product isn't super ambitious from a technical perspective so it seems feasible that I will have something good enough to sell, and to at least have taken a serious shot at doing so, by the end of the 3 months.

Wish me luck!
