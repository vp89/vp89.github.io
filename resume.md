## Resume

My resume is mostly on LinkedIn, I don't go into too much detail about my current role unless
I am actively looking. If you are interested, feel free to contact me through LinkedIn for an
up to date copy of my resume.

This page will act as a Palmar√®s of mine for any technical trainings or projects I complete. This kind of detail
normally doesn't go on a resume so it's valuable to list it on here:
